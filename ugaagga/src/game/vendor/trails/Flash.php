/**
 * The flash provides a way to pass temporary objects between actions.
 * Anything you place in the flash will be exposed to the very next action and
 * then cleared out. This is a great way of doing notices and alerts, such as
 * a create action that sets
 * <tt>$flash->set('notice', "Successfully created")</tt>
 * before redirecting to a display action that can then expose the flash to its
 * template.
